description: Influence Functions are a standard tool for attributing predictions to training data in a principled manner and are widely used in applications such as data valuation and fairness. In this work, we present realistic incentives to manipulate influence-based attributions and investigate whether these attributions can be systematically tampered by an adversary. We show that this is indeed possible for logistic regression models trained on ResNet feature embeddings and standard tabular fairness datasets and provide efficient attacks with backward-friendly implementations. Our work raises questions on the reliability of influence-based attributions in adversarial circumstances. Code is available at [https://github.com/infinite-pursuits/influence-based-attributions-can-be-manipulated](https://github.com/infinite-pursuits/influence-based-attributions-can-be-manipulated).

Threat Model. Data Provider provides training data. Influence Calculator trains a model and computes influence scores for the training data on the trained model and a test set. It outputs both the trained model and the resulting influence scores, which are used for a downstream application such as data valuation or fairness. Adversarial manipulation happens in the model training process, which trains a malicious model to achieve desired influence scores, while maintaining similar accuracy as the honest model..</figcaption>

## Introduction

Influence Functions are a popular tool for data attribution and have been widely used in many applications such as data valuation <d-cite key="richardson2019rewarding, hesse2023data, sundararajan2023inflow, jia2019towards"></d-cite>, data filtering/subsampling/cleaning <d-cite key="wu2022puma, wang2020less, miao2021efficient,teso2021interactive, meng2022active"></d-cite>, fairness <d-cite key="li2022achieving, wang2024fairif, sattigeri2022fair, kong2021resolving, pang2024fair, chhabra2023data, chen2024fast, yao2023understanding, ghosh2023biased"></d-cite> and so on. While earlier they were being used for benign debugging, many of these newer applications involve adversarial scenarios where participants have an incentive to manipulate influence scores; for example, in data valuation a higher monetary sum is given to samples with a higher influence score and since good data is hard to collect, there is an incentive to superficially raise influence scores for existing data. Thus, an understanding of whether and how influence functions can be manipulated is essential to determine their proper usage and for putting guardrails in place. While a lot of work in the literature has studied manipulation of feature-based attributions <d-cite key="heo2019fooling, anders2020fairwashing, slack2020fooling"></d-cite>, whether data attribution methods, specifically influence functions, can be manipulated has not been explored. To this end, our paper investigates the question and shows that it is indeed possible to *systematically* manipulate influence-based attributions according to the manipulator's incentives.

#### Our Key Idea

Simply put, we show that it is possible to systematically train a malicious model very similar to the honest model in test accuracy but has desired influence scores.

## Guarantees of FairProof

In this work, we propose a ZKP system called FairProof to verify the fairness of a model. We want FairProof to give the following three guarantees: 1) ensure that the same model is used for all customers, 2) maintain the confidentiality of the model and 3) the fairness score is correctly computed without manipulation using the fixed model weights only. The first requirement is guaranteed through model commitments -- a cryptographic commitment to the model weights binds the organization to those weights publicly while maintaining confidentiality of the weights and has been widely studied in the ML security literature . The other two requirements are guaranteed with ZKPs.

#### Problem Setting

Consider the following problem setting: on one hand, we have a customer which applies for a loan (i.e. query) and corresponds to the verifier while on the other, we have a bank which uses a machine learning model to make loan decisions and corresponds to the prover. Along with the loan decision, the bank also gives a fairness certificate and a cryptographic proof proving the correct computation of this certificate. The verifier verifies this proof without looking at the model weights.

## Two parts of FairProof

There are two important parts to FairProof : 1) How to calculate the fairness certificate (in-the-clear)? and 2) How to verify this certificate with ZKPs?

#### Fairness Certification in-the-clear

The fairness metric we use is Local Individual Fairness (IF) and give a simple algorithm to calculate this certificate by using a connection between adversarial robustness and IF.  Experimentally, we see that the resulting certification algorithm is able to differentiate between less and more fair models.

#### ZKP for Fairness Certification

Next we must code this certification algorithm in a ZKP library. However, ZKPs are infamous for adding a big computational overhead and can be notoriously hard to code due to only using arithmetic operations. To overcome these challenges, we strategically choose some sub-functionalities which are enough to verify the certificate and also propose to do some computations offline to save time.

Empirically we find that the maximum proof generation time is on ~4 min while the maximum verification time is ~3 seconds (note the change from minutes to seconds). Maximum time is consumed by the VerifyNeighbor functionality. Also the proof size is a meagre 200 KB.

Offline computations are done in the initial setup phase while Online computations are done for every new query. Verification is only done online, for every query. (b) Breakdown of the proof generation time (in mins) for the data point with the median time. VerifyNeighbor sub-functionality takes the maximum time. (c) Average Total Proof Size (in KB) for various models. This includes the proof generated during both online and offline phases.</figcaption>

## Conclusion

In conclusion, we propose FairProof â€“ a protocol enabling model owners to issue publicly verifiable certificates while ensuring model confidentiality. While our work is grounded in fairness and societal applications, we believe that ZKPs are a general-purpose tool and can be a promising solution for overcoming problems arising out of the need for model confidentiality in other areas/applications as well.
